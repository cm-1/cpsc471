Google "HTML to Jade"

Only use the #{} "if you want to interpolate a variable in the contents of an element. you can just use the variable names straight up if you want to use them in attributes."
	E.g.
		h1=article.title
			[Note that you can't have spaces around the '='!]
		-versus-
		h5 Written by #{article.author}
		
Custom js also goes under "Public" folder. Same with custom css.

! Note that console.log in your client-side JS will only show up in the clieng-side console...

BUT, if we're using bcrypt, use BINARY(60) if "comparisons are done in MYSQL", CHAR(60) if they're done in the app.
Following the tutorial (and saving ourselves headache), they'll be done in the app, so we use CHAR(60).

req = request
res = response

Middleware order matters A LOT!
